## What is it?

_Lai Todo_ is a Pomodoro timer application running in the browser. It helps you manage your time so that you can do more work instead of watching videos of cute cats üòø

## What you get

Here's the looong list of features this app includes.

### ‚è∞ **Multiple timer styles**

- (12:34) _traditional_ <br> a classic one with second-precision for those who want to know exactly how much time is left until coffee break
- (12 minutes) _approximate_ <br> this one displays time with minute-precision so you know how much time is left but your eyes won't stick to the counter since it does not change every second
- (50%) _percentage_ <br> being even less informative, this one keeps you away from the distraction of calculating "what can I do in the remaining 12 minutes and 34 seconds?".

### üí° **Friendly, focused and clean user interface**

**It's just the essentials**: a timer in the middle and controls at the bottom. Everything else can be turned off:

- a quick glance at your schedule at the top
- a smart to-do list
- colour-coded sections
- colourful progress bar in the background

### üìë **Flexible schedule**

- adjust the length of your sessions separately or use one of the built-in presets
- set how frequent long pauses are
- **track the time spent beyond the timer**, unlike other timers that stop when the time expires

### üéµ **Multiple ways to notify you**

- play sounds when you finish a section
- desktop notifications so you don't have to keep checking your browser

### ‚öô **Plenty of options**

- set your schedule the way you want it
- toggle the schedule view, the progress bar or the to-do list
- enable/disable audio and/or desktop notifications
- change the number of schedule items shown
- control your timer using the keyboard
- dark and light themes
- ... and more to come in the future!

### ‚úÖ **Clean to-do list**

- set separate tasks for work, pause and long pause sections
- only shows your top relevant tasks while the timer is running
- automatically remove completed tasks at the end of each session
- remembers your tasks across sessions

### ‚ú® **Other nice-to-have features**

- remembers your settings
- it's a _PWA_ (Progressive Web App): it's fast and you can install it through your browser!
- fancy and fluid animations
- setup wizard to get you started
- translated into 5 languages

### ‚úî **Super lightweight**

Only 5.6M.

### üëã **Open development**

Anyone can view the source code, raise issues (feature requests, bug reports) or even submit their own improvements!
